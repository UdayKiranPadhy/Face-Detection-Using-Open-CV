# Face-Detection-Using-Open-CV
This Face Detection uses Haar Cascade Classifiers in order to detect the faces

### Usage cases of Face Detection
There are many real time applications of face recognition, The below mentioned are few of them: 
1) Identify People On Social Media Platforms
2) Count the number of incoming Attendes.
3) Can be used to focus on Face in Front Face Cameras, in potrate modes.
4) Used to capture images to train a Neural Network Model.

### Advantages
1) This is a very lite weigth application , while the other alternative like keras deep learned models requires a lot of resources.
2) Simple to use as compared to other applications

### Disadvantages
1) Since its a pre trained classifier we can't edit it for our personal uses
2) The Accuracy is less as compared to differed Face Detection models depending on the number and quality of training data set.

### How To use
1) Download these files into Your Local machine . You can do it by Clicking on the green color "Code" button and then clicking on the "Download Zip". Extract those files in your local machine.

2) If you have python 3.x installed in your PC then you can safely skip this step , If no then You need to have Python 3.0 (or above) installed in you PC . You can download it from the official link https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.6/python-3.9.6-amd64.exe .

3) Install the dependies required . Open the command prompt and type
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Make sure ur are in the same directory i.e inside the downloaded folder.

4) Run the Programe main.py from that directory
```
python main.py
```
Make sure ur are in the same directory i.e inside the downloaded folder.

5) Press keyboard button "Q" to quit and close all the applications
Press keyboard button "S" to save the picture from your camera.
Press key "Y" to save to the picture including the frame.

6) All the images are saved in the same directory.
