# Face-Detection-Using-Open-CV
This Face Detection uses Haar Cascade Classifiers in order to detect the faces

### Usage cases of Face Detection
There are many real time applications of face recognition, The below mentioned are few of them: 
1) Identify People On Social Media Platforms
2) Count the number of incoming Attendes.
3) Can be used to focus on Face in Front Face Cameras, in potrate modes.
4) Used to capture images to train a Neural Network Model.

### Advantages
1) This is a very lite weigth application , while the other alternative like keras deep learned models requires a lot of resources.
2) Simple to use as compared to other applications

### Disadvantages
1) Since its a pre trained classifier we can't edit it for our personal uses
2) The Accuracy is less as compared to differed Face Detection models depending on the number and quality of training data set.

### How To use
1) Firstly You need to have Python 3.0 (or above) installed in you PC
2) Install the dependies required . Open the command prompt and type
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3) Run the Programe
